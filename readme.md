==> postgresql@16
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgresql@16
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-initdb.html

postgresql@16 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have postgresql@16 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find postgresql@16 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/include"

For pkg-config to find postgresql@16 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/lib/pkgconfig"

To start postgresql@16 now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql@16
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  LC_ALL="C" /usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@16
